Cartographer ROS for TurtleBots
===============================

   :maxdepth: 2
   :hidden:

`Cartographer`_ is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization
and mapping (`SLAM`_) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor
configurations. This repository provides Cartographer SLAM for `TurtleBots`_
via `Cartographer ROS`_.

Building & Installation
=======================

Installation has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) with ROS Indigo, but may
also work on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) with ROS Kinetic. We recommend using
`wstool <http://wiki.ros.org/wstool>`_ and
`rosdep <http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep>`_. For faster builds, we also recommend
using `Ninja <https://ninja-build.org>`_.

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Install wstool and rosdep.
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python-wstool python-rosdep ninja-build

    # Create a new workspace in 'catkin_ws'.
    mkdir catkin_ws
    cd catkin_ws
    wstool init src

    # Merge the cartographer_turtlebot.rosinstall file and fetch code for dependencies.
    wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_turtlebot/master/cartographer_turtlebot.rosinstall
    wstool update -t src

    # Install deb dependencies.
    # The command 'sudo rosdep init' will print an error if you have already
    # executed it since installing ROS. This error can be ignored.
    sudo rosdep init
    rosdep update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y

    # Build and install.
    catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja
    source install_isolated/setup.bash

Running the demo
================

Now that Cartographer, Cartographer ROS, and Cartographer ROS's TurtleBot
integration are installed, download the example bag to a known location, in
this case ``~/Downloads``, and use ``roslaunch`` to bring up the demo:

  .. code-block:: bash

    # Download the example bag.
    wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/turtlebot/cartographer_turtlebot_demo.bag

    # Launch the 2D LIDAR demo.
    roslaunch cartographer_turtlebot demo_lidar_2d.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/cartographer_turtlebot_demo.bag

    # Launch the 2D depth camera demo.
    roslaunch cartographer_turtlebot demo_depth_camera_2d.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/cartographer_turtlebot_demo.bag

    # Launch the 3D depth camera demo.
    roslaunch cartographer_turtlebot demo_depth_camera_3d.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/cartographer_turtlebot_demo.bag

The launch files will bring up ``roscore`` and ``rviz`` automatically.
